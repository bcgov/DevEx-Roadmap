title: Kick Start
---

As a public sector program owner...

I should be able to sponsor my first ever continuous service improvement initiative...

    using the agile methodology, UX/human centered service design, open design/development, and devOps...

      with the assistance of a ready-made program that will train my staff and connect with entrepreneurs and developers...

so that I have tangible results within 6-9 months and a functional, complete, team that can sustain the initiative into future years
