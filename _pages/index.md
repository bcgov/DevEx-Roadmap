### What is the BCDevExchange

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

<div class="page-section">

The BC Developers’ Exchange (BCDevExchange) is experimenting with new ways for tech innovators and government to work together, grow B.C.’s economy, and make services for British Columbians better.

To build better technology services and help B.C.’s tech industry grow we are:

- Creating new, faster, streamlined ways for the public sector to acquire software from the tech community.

- Matching the business needs of government organizations in B.C. with innovations from B.C.’s technology industry.

- Sharing government digital resources – code, data and APIs – that entrepreneurs can use to seed their businesses.



</div>

### Why are we sharing our roadmap

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
{% include progressbar.html %}

<div class="page-section">

We are sharing our service roadmap as part of a concerted effort to engage with B.C.’s tech community, and to enable them to help shape, refine and contribute to the development of the BCDevExchange.

Early on, B.C.’s tech community told us we should build the BCDevExchange in collaboration; advice we have taken to heart.

From the beginning, we published the open source code that powers the BCDevExchange app in GitHub, the popular online code sharing platform, and worked to openly share a growing number of digital resources, including APIs, code and data.

We are partnering with the developers, app builders, start-ups and public sector innovators; those who we want as users of the BCDevExchange.

We invite you to see what we are doing, and we welcome your advice and contributions on how to evolve the BCDevExchange.


</div>

### Where did the roadmap come from

<div class="page-section">

The BCDevExchange team is treating this initiative as a type of “lean start-up” effort, with a customer-centered service design and an Agile methodology. We build, test and refine based on our user’s feedback to ensure we deliver value to them.

The roadmap was derived through work we did with our community last year, and may change based on further feedback from our community.

To create the roadmap, we first examined our research findings on common business needs in the community. We then determined how we could meet those business needs with a range of services that you will find in this roadmap.

We realized that business needs could be grouped into cultural, process and technological transformations with the objectives of accelerating the speed of delivering value and increasing code quality.


</div>

### How to use this roadmap

<div class="page-section">

In broad terms, this roadmap describes the potential services of the BCDevExchange. These are the [Epics](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/delivery-vehicles) – our big pieces of work.

Each Epic has a high-level user story and the stages we will follow, beginning with customer discovery and user research.

For more detail, each Epic is broken down into smaller user stories which can be viewed and commented on in our Kanban boards. At the smaller user story level, you can find and explore the tasks and associated artifacts related to each story.

These Kanban boards organize our user stories into three groups. Using Agile parlance we have our product backlog, work currently underway during our current two-week development sprint, and completed work.

To see what we're working on please visit our [Kanboard](https://trello.com/b/j3Ol7kEr/a-roadmap)

<!-- / INTRODUCTION -->
<!-- KICKSTART -->
<h2 id="Kick_Start">Kick Start Your First Release</h2>

### What is Kick Start
{% include p_kickstart.html %}

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

<div class="page-section">

The BCDevExchange is experimenting with how we – the B.C. public sector - deliver digital service projects. The intent is to deliver faster and continuous user value with new tools and methods using the five service concepts that follow.

This year we are looking for a few government projects to run through a concept we’re calling ‘Kick Start Your First Release’.  The idea is a bootcamp for project teams new to these methodologies:

-	Design Thinking
-	Customer-centered Service Design
-	Lean Start-up and minimum viable product development (e.g. rapid prototyping)
-	Agile Methodology and Scrum
-	DevOps

Government staff on these projects will be trained in these methodologies so they speak the same language as B.C. start-ups and tech entrepreneurs, helping collaboration. A Kick Start project would run until the team completed a series of sprints and made a first release – which could be a working prototype or the first release of production features.  Once the first release is complete the project team could return to their business unit where they could sustain and continue the effort.

Kick Start projects will create a steady supply of code, data, APIs, and paid opportunities for developers who are interested in working with us.

Have thoughts about this idea? Let us know what you think on our [Kanboard](https://trello.com/b/z5aY0htv/kick-start).

<h2 id="Sprint_With_Us">Sprint with Us</h2>

### What is Sprint with Us
{% include p_sprintwu.html %}

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

<div class="page-section">

We want to reduce the paperwork required for the tech sector to work with government, and speed up value creation for the people served by public sector organizations. ‘Sprint with Us’ is a concept to make it easier and faster for the tech community to work with government. This new procurement model would allow government projects to round-out Agile sprint teams to work on government IT projects, rapidly bringing new people and skills onto a sprint team so the work can continue without interruption.  Help us design an easier way for small, experienced and qualified development teams to quickly step into government projects. We welcome your ideas on our [Kanboard](https://trello.com/b/5GaODBBc/sprint-with-us).

<!-- CODE FOR GOVERNMENT READY PRODUCTS -->
<h2 id="Code4Gov">Code for Government Ready Products</h2>

### What is Code for Gov Ready Products
{% include p_code4gov.html %}

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="page-section">

The concept of ‘Code for Government Ready Products’ is to enable tech entrepreneurs and software developers to build products that can be easily accepted by government and rapidly deployed from the development environment to the production environment.  Current practice involves working through traditional procurements and traditional software development lifecycles where the rules and requirements for building information systems are written into voluminous documents that are hard to read, write and maintain.  The idea behind ‘Code for Government Ready Products’ is for  government to open source complete systems, with all the system  functionality and security, privacy, data conformance and other standards.  This way B.C tech entrepreneurs and software developers could take the system’s complete source code and modify the functions to solve a business need.  To make this all work we are exploring a combination of tools that allow for faster and easier collaboration with entrepreneurs, companies and start-ups in the B.C. tech sector. Come to our [KanBoard](https://trello.com/b/39R3K5dd/code-4-gov) to collaborate.

<!-- CODE WITH US - Paid -->
<h2 class="epic_title" id="Code_With_Us_Paid">Code With Us - Paid</h2>

### What is Code With Us – Paid
{% include p_codewupaid.html %}

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="page-section">

Code With Us - Paid will be a foundational tool for collaboration on the BCDevExchange between government projects and the tech community. An experimental procurement model formerly called ‘Pay for Pull’, Code with Us - Paid offers a monetary reward, or  bounty as a new way to attract developers to work on public sector tech projects. We create an issue in GitHub, the popular code sharing platform, and label it with ‘Help Wanted” and a value (e.g. $1000). In the issue we will explain what we want done, sparking conversation between government technical staff and developers interested in doing the work. Interested developers can do the work and send us their code in GitHub – using a pull request. If we accept the code, we pay the developer via PayPal.

We tested this model and are now making changes based on what we learned from our community feedback. These changes include a way to assign the work to one developer, transaction amounts higher than $1000, more payment options than just PayPal, notification of challenges and ways to improve the confidence of the government technical contacts responsible for accepting code submissions. Track our progress on our [KanBoard](https://trello.com/b/HiFIKN0j/devex-challenge-bounty) and tell us what you think.
