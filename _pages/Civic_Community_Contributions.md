title: Code With Us - Civic Community Contributions
---

1. As a developer, I want to easily contribute work to BC Public Sector programs without time pressure so that I can help improve services and my community.

2. As a program owner, I want to obtain volunteer contributions from developers so that I can improve my programs and services faster and build a community of knowledge for my product.
