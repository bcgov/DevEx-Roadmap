###Initiation

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/Process_Initiation.png" alt="Process Initiation">

This phase begins with a request for a new or modified technology product or service. It may come from any one of a number of areas. Some examples are:

* A ministry partner desires some new product or service
* An individual SDU proposes a new product or service
* There is a decision across government to provide the public with a new product or service

This new IT product and service may take the form of a custom-built service, provisioned fully by government or it could also include components from vendors, ranging from specific hardware/software items or an entire Software as a Service (SaaS) solution.

####*Inputs*:

* Request for a new product or service

* Strategic plans (e.g., 5 pillars)

* Available resources

* Documented understanding of the requirement

* Data entered into Clarity (Project Portfolio Management tool)

####*Outputs:*

* Requests for resources

* Documentation of the business requirements

* Understanding of the business objectives

* Validation of the alignment to BC Government strategic direction

####*Process:*

1.  Discuss high-level objectives and rationale

2.  Assess request as to its feasibility

    * Should we do this?

    * Do we have the resources to start?

    * Can we build it right?

The process ends when there is agreement on the three questions. If the answer is ‘No” to any of the three, this creates the conditions to exit the initiation phase and to not proceed on to the next phase. If the answer is “yes” to all three questions, a team may be formed to proceed into Phase 2.
